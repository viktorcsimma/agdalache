What is the Agda SDK?
*********************

The Agda SDK is a project intended to help developers
utilising Agda-powered, provably correct backends
in C++ Qt applications
using the _agda2hs_ compiler.

It consists of:
- installation scripts for fetching all the necessary tools from the Internet;
- a project template to get you started in no time;
- several pre-made frameworks to help you interact with the backend from C++ (e.g. Haskell futures);
- this documentation.

In order to utilise the SDK, a basic understanding of Agda is needed,
as well as an intermediate proficiency in Haskell
(i.e. knowing the IO monad and not refraining from using the documentation).
However, frontend developers can join the C++ part of your project,
even with no knowledge of Agda at all!

Check out the chapter **Getting started** to install the SDK
and **Tutorial** to get a basic idea of how to use it.
