Contributions are very welcome!
You can help improve any part of the SDK,
including:

* agda2hs (both the compiler itself and the library) -- but for this, make a PR to the ``the-agda-sdk`` branch of ``github.com/viktorcsimma/agda2hs``;
* the build files (CMake, Cabal etc.);
* the folder structure;
* the tools included (either the Agda/Haskell or the C/C++ ones);
* and, of course, this documentation.

If you have questions, reach out anytime at
[csimmaviktor03] [at] [<the-mail-service-of-google>.com].
I would definitely be thrilled to hear from you:)
