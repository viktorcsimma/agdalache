Contributions are very welcome!
You can help improve any part of the SDK,
including:
* agda2hs (both the compiler itself and the library) -- but for this, make a PR to the `have-it-both-ways` branch of `viktorcsimma/agda2hs`;
* the build files (CMake, Cabal etc.);
* the folder structure;
* the tools included (either the Agda/Haskell or the C/C++ ones);
* and, of course, this documentation.

If you have questions, reach out anytime at
[csimmaviktor03] [at] [<the-most-popular-online-email-provider>.com].
I would definitely be thrilled to hear from you:)
