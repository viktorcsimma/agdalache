Main functions
**************

There are two Haskell files containing main functions:
Main.hs for the console application itself
and TestMain.hs for Haskell-based tests.
These have to be written in plain Haskell files,
as Cabal cannot handle autogenerated files as main modules.

The skeleton project contains the code of a command prompt
as an example Main.hs,
but you can write any program here.
If you do not need a console application at all,
you can simply ignore it
and remove it as targets from the project files.

TestMain.hs is for QuickCheck-based Haskell tests
runnable via ``cabal test``.
See the :ref:`backend-testing`
for more information.
